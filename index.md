### Bio

I am a first year graduate student at MIT coadvised by Leslie Kaelbling, Tomas Lozano-Perez and Joshua Tenenbaum. I'm interested in attempting to build intelligent robotic agents that can perceive and interact with the world around them. 

In the past, I was a research collaborator at FAIR, a fellow at OpenAI and received gold medals at the International Biology Olympiad.
