Hi, I'm Yilun Du, currently a sophomore at MIT double majoring in computer science and mathematics.

### Interests

One of my major interests is human cognition and perception of the environment around them. I am especially interested
in computational models that are able to carry to complicated tasks such as understanding document sentiment, analyzing facial expression,
and strategizing for complex games.
